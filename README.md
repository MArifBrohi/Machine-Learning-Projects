# Introduction

This project is focused on analyzing WhatsApp chat logs and providing various charts and 
visualizations that help understand patterns and trends in conversations. This project is 
focused on analyzing WhatsApp chat logs and presenting the data in various charts and 
visualizations. The main goal of the project is to make it easy for users to understand 
patterns and trends in their WhatsApp conversations. Users can analyze both individual and 
group chats. The project uses the Streamlit library for web application development, 
Matplotlib, Plotly, and Pandas for data visualization, and various other libraries for data 
processing and analysis. The project consists of three main files: app.py, preprocessor.py, 
and helper.py. To use the webapp, users will need to export their WhatsApp chat logs as a 
text file and upload it to the website. The website will then provide various charts and 
visualizations of the data.

# Abstract

hidden facts in them. This project takes those chats and provide a deep analysis of that 
data. Being any topic, the chats are it provide the analysis in an efficient and accurate way. 
The main advantage of this project is that it has been built using libraries like pandas, 
seaborn, matplotlib, emoji etc. They are used to create data frames and plot graphs in an 
efficient way. Keywords: WhatsApp Chat, Python, Stream lit, Analysis, Nature Language 
Processing, Emoji, Pandas, Matplotlib.
